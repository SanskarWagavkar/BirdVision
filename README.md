# Flask E-Commerce API

This is a RESTful API built with Flask for managing products in an e-commerce application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)
- SQLite or PostgreSQL (based on your preference)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/flask-ecommerce-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   - Install PostgreSQL if you haven't already.
   - Create a new PostgreSQL database.
   - Update the database connection URI in `config.py`.

### Running the API
